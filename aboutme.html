        <p>I am YogaNarasimhaReddy from Kurnool born on 04-FEB-1997. Completed my Undergraduation at Manipal University
           in Civil Engineering. After my UG I joined OSI Digital as an Oracle Ebs Technical Consultant and worked for 2.5 year.
           Working at OSI gave me good knowledge in SQL, PL/SQL, Interfaces, API's, Oracle Forms and Reports. I had to 
           quit working at OSI in 2021 to pursue my Masters in Applied Computer Science at NorthWest Missouri State University.

            There are a number of psychological reasons for the popularity of superhero movies. 
            Experts point to the genreâ€™s escapism as the primary reason why we want to watch superhero movies.
            We can relax and forget our everyday problems. Moreover, superheroes are 
            like role models many people want to live up to: a viewer likes the idea of saving others, 
            being brave and popular, and fighting against the evil. Superheroes incorporate the idea of justice,
            loyalty, truth, and power and these are all things we as an audience give great value to in society.
