        <h4>Linear operations Algorithm</h4>
        <blockquote cite=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming>Linear programming (LP, also called linear optimization) is a method to achieve the best outcome
           (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented 
           by linear relationships. Linear programming is a special case of mathematical programming (also known 
           as mathematical optimization).</blockquote ><br>
