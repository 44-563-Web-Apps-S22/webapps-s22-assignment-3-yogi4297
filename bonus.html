    <h3><b><i>Pirate Parrot</i></b></h3>

    <p>
        The Pirate Parrot is a costumed mascot of the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball.
        He was introduced in 1979 in response to the popularity of the <i>Phillie Phanatic</i> introduced 
        one year earlier, as the Pirates and Philadelphia Phillies had a fierce intrastate rivalry at the time.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The character of a parrot was derived from the classic story <i>Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson</i>, most notably the one owned by Long John Silver named Captain Flint.</li>
        <li>The Parrot debuted on <i>April Fools' Day, 1979</i> when he hatched at Three Rivers Stadium.</li>
        <li><i>Kevin Koch</i>, the original portrayer of the Pirate Parrot, was later discovered to be high from cocaine during several games as the Pirate Parrot, and was later discovered to be the "middle man" between players and drug dealers, introducing them to cocaine.</li>
    </ul>
